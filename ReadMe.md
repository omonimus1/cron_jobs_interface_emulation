# Goal of the project

Create a bash script able to emulate the set of commands of the crontab command in Unix/Linux systems. 
The user will be able to:
* Add a new crontab job.
* Display crontab jobs (if at least one crontab job has been created).

* Remove a crontab job.
* Remove all the crontab job.

# My role

I have worked on:
* Design of the script.
* Add-job function.
* Coding review of the display-jobs function.
* Buf fixing of the edit-job function.
* Final coding review and testing of the script (approved and checked by Simone and Taylor)
* Write part of the documentation

# Essentials information

* Make sure to have the crontab file in the same working directory of the script.
